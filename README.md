Project to convert the calendar latex class to LaTeX/LaTeX3

The purpose of this project is to convert the calendar class from CTAN from pure TeX to LaTeX2e/LaTeX3. It is motivated by a desire to update the calendar class to a more readable form, with the ultimate goal of converting the class for use with LaTeX3. The two clear goals of this project are currently:

1. Change as much code as possible from plain TeX to LaTeX (including LaTeX3)
2. Remove old dependencies (dates.cls, autofilo.cls) and replace with more up to date files included in modern TeX distributions e.g. replacing dates with datetime.

I'm going to be fairly fast and loose with accepting pull requests with this project; if the pull request has converted TeX into LaTeX (_especially_ if it's LaTeX3) and it compiles, there's a very high chance I'll accept it. So if you're a TeX wizard in need of a cause or you've just learnt TeX and want to test your understanding, this is the project for you!
